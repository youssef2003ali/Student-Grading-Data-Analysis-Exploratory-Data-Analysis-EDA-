# tudent-Grading-Data-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
🔍 Project Overview
This project involves performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student grading dataset to uncover key patterns, relationships, and insights that influence academic performance. By leveraging statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the project explores factors such as attendance, study hours, stress levels, extracurricular activities, and parental education to understand their impact on students' final grades.

📊 Key Features & Analysis
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, checked data distributions, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Explored numerical and categorical features to identify trends and correlations.
Attendance & Performance Correlation: Examined how attendance percentage correlates with final scores and grades.
Study Hours & Academic Success: Analyzed the effect of study hours per week on students' grades.
Gender-Based Comparisons: Compared male and female students in terms of stress levels, study hours, sleep hours, and attendance.
Department-wise Insights: Investigated how different departments performed in terms of stress levels, grades, and other academic metrics.
Parental Education Influence: Assessed whether students' performance is affected by their parents' education level.
Correlation Heatmap: Identified strong relationships between numerical features, such as study hours, attendance, and final scores.
📌 Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Visualization: Heatmaps, Box Plots, Histograms, Count Plots, Scatter Plots, Pie Charts
🎯 Key Insights & Findings
Higher attendance generally correlates with better grades.
Increased study hours per week is often linked to higher academic performance.
Students with high stress levels may show variations in academic performance, depending on other influencing factors.
Certain departments report higher or lower stress levels, potentially affecting student outcomes.
Parental education level can be an influencing factor in students' grades, with variations observed across different education levels.
🚀 Outcome & Impact
This project provides valuable insights into the key academic and behavioral factors affecting student performance. It serves as a useful analytical tool for educators, institutions, and researchers to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving student success and well-being.
