# 🎓 Student Grading Data Analysis & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **student grading dataset** to uncover key factors influencing academic performance. By leveraging **data visualization and statistical analysis**, we explore how variables like **attendance, study hours, stress levels, extracurricular activities, and parental education** impact students' final grades.

## 🚀 Features & Analysis  
✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.  
✔️ **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis** – Examining numerical and categorical feature distributions.  
✔️ **Attendance & Performance Correlation** – Analyzing how attendance impacts final grades.  
✔️ **Study Hours vs Grades** – Investigating the relationship between study time and academic performance.  
✔️ **Gender-Based Comparisons** – Comparing stress levels, study habits, and grades by gender.  
✔️ **Department-wise Insights** – Exploring grade distribution and stress levels across departments.  
✔️ **Parental Education Influence** – Assessing the impact of parental education on student success.  
✔️ **Correlation Heatmap** – Identifying relationships between numerical variables.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Visualization Techniques**: Heatmaps, Box Plots, Histograms, Count Plots, Scatter Plots, Pie Charts  

## 📊 Key Insights  
🔹 Students with higher **attendance percentages** tend to have **higher final scores**.  
🔹 **More study hours per week** are generally linked to **better academic performance**.  
🔹 **Stress levels vary across students**, affecting academic outcomes differently.  
🔹 Some **departments** report higher stress levels, impacting performance.  
🔹 **Parental education level** shows patterns in influencing student grades.
